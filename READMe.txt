To use this program it is needed the files with data relative to the movies:

1- go to this link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/
2- download ml-latest.zip and extract its files to the same directory as recomendation_system.py
3- mantain the same name for the directory when extracted (ml-latest)

The directory should look like (files were too big to put in the repository):
APSEI_RS_example
	.git
	ml-latest
	README.txt
	recomendation_system.zip

Packages to install (files were too big to put in the repository):
	- pandas
	- scipy.parse ( or just scipy)
	- sklearn.neighbors ( or just sklearn)
	- fuzzywuzzy
